I _will_ be explaining three out of ten lab assignments I did for this assignment.
Each assignment _requires_ me to use a **_p5js_** sketch and an app called **Sublime Text.**
Each assignment _shows_ a list of requirements in order to have a good grade for each assignment.
The **_p5js_** sketch is used to type your code in and it shows the picture of what your code represents.
The **Sublime Text** is the same as the **_p5js_** except it doesn't show a picture.
Each assignment shows a list of functions and variables needed for each assignment.
I am about to explain the _specifics_ for Lab Assignment three, four, and five.

>Here are the _variables_ that Lab Assignment 3 includes:
* **framerate()**
* **mouseX and mouseY**
* **pmouseX and pmouseY**
* **pow()**
* **sqrt()**
* **abs()**
* **dist()**
* **radians()**
>The grade for the lab assignment wasn't great from my professor, but the link for the assignment is below.

>Here are the _functions_ that Lab Assignment 4 includes:
* **mouseClicked()**
* **mousePressed()**
* **keyIsPressed()**
* **if**
* **else if**
* **for()**
* while()
>The grade for lab assignment 4 was better, so the link will be down below.

>Here are the _functions_ that Lab Assignment 5 includes:
* **ellipseMode()**
* **mouseClicked()**
* **mousePressed()**
* **mouseX**
* **mouseY**
* **keyIsPressed()**
* **if**
* **if else**
>The grade for lab assignment 5 was really good as well, so the link will be down below.

Each assignment requires us to _design_ a composition like for example, I have to make one that is within the theme of a TV.
Each assignment even includes examples for some assistance on typing a code for each one.
Each assignment even have us _use_ a link called **The Adobe Color** to select groups of colors using different systems.
Each assignment _shows_ me how to turn in an assignment.
>I struggled figuring out how to turn each one in when I first started this **MAGD class.**
>I would have to _compress_ my created assignment folder that should be named by your last name.
>The folder would have to contain your **_p5js_** work and your **Sublime Text** work.
>I have to _compress_ the folder to turn it into a **.zip** file.
